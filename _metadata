  "description" : "(If you want a big pack of A.I. chips instead of a fragmented collection, please look here: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=947922190 )\n\nI took the hardcoded vanilla S.A.I.L. interface and rewrote it's logic in Lua, thus giving me the ability to add some fancy features, but most notably, to allow easy S.A.I.L. changes and modding via config chips. (it also has some cool animations for buttons)\n\nMore specifically, this S.A.I.L. will take it's configuration from the defaults, then from the specie's defaults, then from each config chips. Each of these configuration is merged, where latest overwrite the oldest if configs 'collide'. This allows, for example, to have that cute Felin S.A.I.L. overwrite the appearance of A.V.I.A.N., that overwrites the dialogs of your vanilla yellow glitch bald thingy.\n[b]tl;dr have a gif:[/b]\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/E3qkZ2A.gif[/img]\nThe mod itself comes with chips to change the appearance to the older S.A.I.L. versions, but I've stolen (literally) a good load of other mods' S.A.I.L.s and made chips for them there: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=943637272\n[strike]Hopefully I don't annoy anyone by doing this, nor get sent any lawyer. [/strike]\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/ni4SKy8.gif[/img]\n[strike](^note that this gif's a bit outdated, I added the breadcrumb thingies's (home, missions, config) translation and fixed the last one being superbig now)[/strike]\n\nI've also added a kind-of-still-WIP (it works but I'm not sure of the implementation) ability to change the appearance of the S.A.I.L. object itself to another one, with it's animations and everything. It should work with any techstation you can find that is somewhat similar to the vanilla one, but you'll probably need to spawn it yourself via an admin command.\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/gzgHir6.gif[/img]\n\n[b][h1]This mod has some caveats though[/h1][/b]\nThe main one is the fact that we cannot read the player's available missions via Lua. Because of this, this S.A.I.L. have to \"guess\" which missions the player has, based on their quests.\nFrom what I've tested this works okay, but it means that I have to manually add the quest <-> mission thing in some table. (I've made it easy to mod that tho, in case I stop updating it)\nIn case of it not seeing a mission though, I've set up a \"fallback to vanilla S.A.I.L.\" button that will temporarily bring back the old S.A.I.L., which will see all of your quests.\nHopefully we'll have the required Lua bindings soon!\n\n[b]Currently, missions from these mods should be available out of the box:[/b]\n- FU & Extra Dungeons probably\n- Gyrusens+\n- Greckan\n\nAnother problem is that the radiomessages thingies' face are hardcoded and I cannot easily script them. This means that, even if you have a cute anime S.A.I.L. in your ship, when you run down the lunar base, the good ol' S.A.I.L. will appear to notify you of the danger.\n\nIf you want to go multiplayer with this, everyone participating will have to download this mod, and the S.A.I.L. config chips you've subscribed to.\n\nFor this mod to work, it requires patching the techstation (S.A.I.L. object thingy). I've tried to make it as fully compatible with other mods as possible, but I might have missed some. Feel free to ask for a compatibility patch!\n\nThis mod should work out of the box with all of the species in that collection -> http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=880050795\n\n\n[b][h1]Possible incompatibilities:[/h1][/b]\n- this mod overwrites /quests/scripts/main.lua and /quests/scripts/portraits.lua. Any mod that does the same will result in S.A.I.L.'s icon in the quest log won't be matching your S.A.I.L.\nI only know of the A.V.I.A.N. SAIL mod that does this.\n\n- Any mod that patches the vanilla interface might make the \"failsafe S.A.I.L.\" look different.\n\n- Any mod that overwrites /ai/*.png and /ai/portraits/*.png might result in missmatching S.A.I.L. visuals.\nThat should be everything.\n\n\n\n[b][h1]!! before uninstalling!![/h1][/b]\nPlease remove your S.A.I.L. console from your ship. To do so, you can hover your mouse over it, and type in the in-game chat:\n[code]\n/admin\n/entityeval object.name()\n/entityeval object.smash(true)\n[/code]\nThen, once you've uninstalled the mod, return in-game, and type\n[code]\n/spawnitem <the name that object.name() returned earlier> 1 '{\"unbreakable\": true}'\n/admin\n[/code]\nand place the spawned techstation, and you should be set.\nIf you do not do this, your ship will error out each time you load it up because some scripts will be missing.\n\n\nI've considered:\n- Adding a \"ship pet\" config slot, but Purchasable Pets already does this.\n- Making the config chips be dropped in chests around the universe instead of being craftable, (\"Oh cool, I found a new S.A.I.L. chip!\", but I didn't wanted to have people who only wanted to customize their S.A.I.L. to be stuck with luck (\"hnng, when will I finally find my chip?!\"). \n(It'd also require a bit more work from me than a simple recipe file so there's that)\n- Putting the S.A.I.L. stations with their corresponding chip A.I. (eg. Felin techstation with Felin A.I. chip), but that felt kind of bloated, and it'd require me to overwrite already-existing items instead of using the patching system, which isn't really nice.\n- Using the 3rd chip config slot for S.A.I.L. station customization instead of using yet another item, but it didn't seemed logical to change a physical object from a digital interface. Also, the idea of taking a screwdriver and removing the front pannel of the S.A.I.L. station is pretty cool.\n- Something to merge chips together. The implementation should already allow for this, I just haven't gotten around to make something to actually \"merge\" them, and with 3 slots it's kind of not really useful anyway?\n- Some more things that I forgot, probably.\n\nMany thanks to Storm_UK and his hobo.lua script, Magicks and the others at the starbound discord's modding channel, and all the people I stole their S.A.I.L. from who haven't killed me yet.\n(And you for using this?!!)\n\nAlso available on github: https://github.com/xn-5o8h/sbmod_scriptedsail",
